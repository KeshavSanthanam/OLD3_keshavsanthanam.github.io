most technical objections aren't really technical
- "doesn't integrate with our stack" = we don't want to change
- "security concerns" = we need approval from someone else
- "performance issues" = we heard something from a competitor

when they raise technical concerns
- ask for specifics
- "what specifically about security concerns you?"
- "which integrations are must-haves?"

don't immediately solve the objection
- might not be the real issue
- might be testing if you know your stuff
- might be their way of saying "not interested"

validate first, then solve
- "that makes sense, other customers had the same concern"
- then explain how you addressed it

get technical with technical people
- they can smell BS
- admit limitations
- explain tradeoffs

with non-technical people
- keep it high level
- focus on outcomes
- use analogies

sometimes the objection is legitimate
- don't force a bad fit
- better to walk away than have an unhappy customer
