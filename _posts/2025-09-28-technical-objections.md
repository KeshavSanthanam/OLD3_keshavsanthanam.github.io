Most technical objections aren't strictly technical.
- "doesn't integrate with our stack" = we don't want to change
- "security concerns" = we need approval from someone else (get Cybersecurity in the demo!)
- "performance issues" = we heard something from a competitor

When they raise technical concerns...
- ask for specifics
- "what specifically about security concerns you?"
- "which integrations are must-haves?"

Don't immediately solve the objection
- might not be the real issue
- might be testing if you know your stuff
- might be their way of saying "not interested"

Validate first, then solve
- "that makes sense, other customers had the same concern"
- then explain how you addressed it

Get technical with technical people
- they can smell BS
- admit limitations
- explain tradeoffs

For non-technical people:
- keep it high level
- focus on outcomes
- use analogies

Sometimes the objection is legitimate
- may be better to walk away than have an unhappy customer
