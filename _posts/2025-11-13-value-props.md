## Features vs Benefits vs Value
- Feature: what it does ("has automated deployment")
- Benefit: what that enables ("deploys in 5 min instead of 2 hours")
- Value: what that means for the business ("dev team ships 3x faster, gets to market sooner")

## The formula
[specific outcome] for [specific persona] by [how you do it differently]

Example: "Reduce deployment time by 70% for engineering teams by automating the entire CI/CD pipeline"

That's better than "we have great CI/CD automation".

## Tailoring to persona
Different people care about different things:

**Developers**
- Does it make coding easier?
- Good docs/support?

**Engineering Managers**
- Team productivity
- Reduced bugs/incidents
- Easier hiring/onboarding

**Executives**
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Competitive advantage

## Quantifying value
"50% faster" is okay, but "Save 10 hours per week per engineer" is better.

Try to tie technical improvements to business metrics:
- Faster deploys --> quicker time to market --> more revenue
- Fewer bugs --> less downtime --> greater customer satisfaction

## The "so what" test
After every value statement ask "so what?"

"We have kubernetes support"
So what?
"So you can deploy anywhere"
So what?
"So you're not locked into one cloud provider"
So what?
"So you can negotiate better pricing and avoid vendor lock-in"

Keep going until you hit something they actually care about.
