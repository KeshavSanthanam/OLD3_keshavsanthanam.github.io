Been studying how to articulate value propositions better. It's not just about listing features.

## Features vs Benefits vs Value
- Feature: what it does ("has automated deployment")
- Benefit: what that enables ("deploys in 5 min instead of 2 hours")
- Value: what that means for the business ("eng team ships 3x faster, gets to market sooner")

Gotta speak in terms of value not features. Especially with executives who don't care about the technical details.

## The formula
[specific outcome] for [specific persona] by [how you do it differently]

Example: "Reduce deployment time by 70% for engineering teams by automating the entire CI/CD pipeline"

That's better than "we have great CI/CD automation"

## Tailoring to persona
Different people care about different things:

**Developers**
- Does it make my life easier?
- Is it reliable?
- Good docs/support?

**Engineering Managers**
- Team productivity
- Reduced bugs/incidents
- Easier hiring/onboarding

**Executives**
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Competitive advantage

Same product, different value props depending on who you're talking to.

## Quantifying value
Numbers matter. "Faster" is vague. "50% faster" is better. "Save 10 hours per week per engineer" is even better.

Try to tie technical improvements to business metrics:
- Faster deploys → quicker time to market → revenue
- Fewer bugs → less downtime → customer satisfaction

## The "so what" test
After every value statement ask "so what?"

"We have kubernetes support"
So what?
"So you can deploy anywhere"
So what?
"So you're not locked into one cloud provider"
So what?
"So you can negotiate better pricing and avoid vendor lock-in"

Keep going until you hit something they actually care about.

Still working on this but the key seems to be: always connect technical capabilities to business outcomes that matter to the specific person you're talking to.
