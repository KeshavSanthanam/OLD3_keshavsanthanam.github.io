title: Reflective Listening - Harder Than it Sounds

Spent some time this weekend practicing reflective listening techniques. It's one of those things that sounds simple but is actually pretty hard to do well.

## What it actually is
Basically you repeat back what the customer said but in your own words. The goal is to show you understand AND give them a chance to correct you if you got it wrong.

Example:
- Customer: "Our deployment process takes forever and the ops team hates it"
- You: "So it sounds like deployment speed is a pain point and it's creating friction with operations?"

## Why its useful
1. Builds trust (people like being heard)
2. Uncovers misunderstandings early
3. Slows down the conversation in a good way
4. Makes the customer feel understood

## What I've noticed
When you do it right the customer often expands on what they said. Like they'll say "yeah exactly, and also..." and give you even more context. That's gold for understanding their real needs.

Technical folks sometimes see this as "soft skills" and dismiss it but I think it's actually super important. You can't build the right solution if you don't understand the problem.

Gonna keep practicing this.
