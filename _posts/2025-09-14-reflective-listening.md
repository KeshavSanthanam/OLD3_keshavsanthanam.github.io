## What it actually is
Basically, you repeat back what the customer said but in your own words. The goal is to show you understand AND give them a chance to correct you if you got it wrong.

Example:
- Customer: "Our deployment process takes forever and the ops team hates it"
- You: "So it sounds like deployment speed is a pain point and it's creating friction with operations?"

NOTE: There is usually some amount of break between these statements or else it sounds weird like above. 

## Why its useful
1. Builds trust (people like being heard)
2. Uncovers misunderstandings early
3. Slows down the conversation
4. Makes the customer feel understood

## What I've noticed
When you do it right, the customer often expands on what they said. Like they'll say "yeah exactly, and also..." and give you even more context. That's helpful for understanding their real needs.

## My **personal*" strategy
Reflect feelings/meaning or paraphrase/validate/confirm. 

### Choice phrases
- "it sounds like..."
- "so the core issue is..."
