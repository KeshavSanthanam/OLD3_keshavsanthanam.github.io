you need an internal champion
- someone who sells for you when you're not there
- someone who navigates internal politics
- someone who actually wants you to win

champions aren't found, they're built
- find someone who feels the pain most
- make them look good
- give them ammunition to sell internally

make your champion successful
- arm them with ROI numbers
- prep them for objections they'll hear
- give them slides they can present
- practice the pitch with them

red flags
- they can't get you meetings with other stakeholders
- they don't respond quickly
- they can't articulate the value prop
- they're not a decision maker OR connected to decision makers

test your champion
- ask them to explain the solution to someone else
- see if they can handle objections
- check if they're actually advocating for you

multi-threading
- don't rely on one champion
- build relationships across the org
- but one primary champion who drives it

lose your champion = probably lose the deal
- people leave companies
- priorities change
- political dynamics shift

champion relationship is ongoing
- even after the sale
- they become your reference
- they refer you to their network
