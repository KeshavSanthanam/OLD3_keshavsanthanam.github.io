Internal champion: 
- someone who sells for you when you're not there and is embedded with the customer

Champions aren't found; they're built. 
- find someone who feels the pain most and resolve it
- make them look good IF the sale happens
- give them ammunition (supporting evidence) to sell internally

Metrics for champion: 
- arm them with ROI numbers
- prep them for objections they'll hear
- give them slides they can present
- practice the pitch with them

Red flags
- they can't get you meetings with other stakeholders
- they don't respond quickly
- they can't articulate the value prop
- they're not a decision maker OR connected to decision makers

Test your champion
- ask them to explain the solution to someone else
- see if they can handle objections
- check if they're actually advocating for you

Multi-threading (multiple champions but ONE primary one)
- losing a champion means you're done

Champion relationship is ongoing post-sale
- they become your reference
- they refer you to their network
