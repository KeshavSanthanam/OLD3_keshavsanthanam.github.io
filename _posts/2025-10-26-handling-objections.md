## The framework
1. **Listen fully** - don't interrupt even if you know the answer
2. **Acknowledge** - "That's a fair concern" or "I understand why that matters"
3. **Clarify** - "When you say expensive, are you comparing to X or concerned about ROI?"
4. **Respond** - address the actual concern, not what you think they meant
5. **Confirm** - "Does that address your concern?"

## Price objections
Usually price objections are about value. "Too expensive" often means:
- "I don't see the value yet"
- "I don't have budget for this"
- "I'm not the decision maker"

The trick is to figure out which one it is.

## The worst response
"You're wrong" or "That's not a real issue".
