POC = letting the customer test drive your product

## Before you start
Need to define success criteria. Ask:
- What does success look like for this POC?
- Who needs to sign off?
- What's the timeline?
- What happens if it goes well/poorly?

If you can't get clear answers to these, the POC might be a waste of time.

## Scope creep is real
Customers will want to test everything. You need to push back (nicely) and focus on the core use case.

Bad POC: "Let's try it with all 50 integrations across 3 departments"
Good POC: "Let's prove it works for the sales team's top use case first"

## Common POC mistakes
- No clear timeline
- Too many stakeholders
- Unclear success metrics
- No executive sponsor

## Success metrics
These need to be specific and measurable. Not "see if it's faster" but "reduce process time from 2 hours to 30 minutes"

Examples that work:
- Reduce deployment time by 50%
- Handle 100 requests without errors
- Get thumbs up from 8/10 test users

## Converting POCs
The whole point is to get to a decision. End of POC should include:
- Results review meeting
- Comparison to success criteria
- Discussion of next steps

Don't let POCs end with "interesting, we'll think about it." Push for a decision or at least a clear timeline for one.

Anyway those are my notes. POCs seem like they can be super valuable or complete time sinks depending on how you set them up.
