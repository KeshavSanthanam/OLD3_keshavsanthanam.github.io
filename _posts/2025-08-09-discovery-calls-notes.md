Been reading up on discovery calls lately and thought I'd jot down some key things.

## The main idea
Discovery isn't about pitching - its about understanding. Need to fight the urge to jump into solution mode too early, which is hard when you know the product so well.

## Questions that work
- "Walk me through your current process for..."
- "What happens when X breaks?"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline looking like?"

The key is to ask open ended questions and then **shut up**. Silence is your friend here. Let them fill it.

## Things I keep forgetting
- Take notes visibly (shows you care)
- Repeat back what they said to confirm understanding
- Always end with clear next steps

One thing that's interesting - technical people often want to dive deep into specs right away but business stakeholders care more about outcomes. Gotta read the room and adjust.

Anyway that's what I've been thinking about. Discovery seems like the foundation of everything else in sales engineering.
