## The main idea
Discovery is all about making the customer feel understood. You need to fight the urge to jump into solution mode too early, which is hard when you know the product so well.

## Questions that work
- "Walk me through your current process for..."
- "What happens when X breaks?"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline looking like?"

The key is to ask open ended questions and then **shut up**. 

## Things I keep forgetting in demos
- Take notes visibly (shows you care)
- Repeat back what they said to confirm understanding (reflective listening)
- Always overview your next steps
