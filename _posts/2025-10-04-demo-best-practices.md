Been thinking about what makes a good demo vs a bad one. Did a practice run today and realized I was making some classic mistakes.

## The golden rule
Show don't tell. And more importantly - show THEIR use case, not every feature you have.

## Demo structure that seems to work
1. Start with the outcome (here's what you'll be able to do)
2. Show the problem (this is painful today)
3. Show the solution (here's how we fix it)
4. Tie back to their specific situation

## Things that kill demos
- Spending too long on setup/config
- Showing features they don't need
- Going too fast (slow down!)
- Technical difficulties with no backup plan

## Technical difficulties
Always have a backup. Seriously. I've seen demos die because of wifi issues or environment problems. Options:
- Recorded demo as backup
- Local environment that doesn't need internet
- Screenshots/slides of key points

## The ending matters
Don't just trail off. End with:
- Summary of what they saw
- How it solves THEIR problem
- Clear next steps

One more thing - using their data/terminology makes a huge difference. If they call it "projects" don't call it "workspaces" in your demo. Seems small but it matters.

Still learning but getting better at this.
