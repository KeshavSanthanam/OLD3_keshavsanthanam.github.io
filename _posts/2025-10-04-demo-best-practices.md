Been thinking about what makes a good demo vs a bad one. From my first 5 practice runs:

## The golden rule
Show THEIR use case, not every feature you have.

## Demo structure that seems to work
1. Start with the outcome (here's what you'll be able to do)
2. Show the problem (this is painful today)
3. Show the solution (here's how we fix it)
4. Tie back to their specific situation

## Things that kill demos
- Spending too long on setup/config (maintain the 5 min split time)
- Showing features they don't need
- Going too fast
- Technical difficulties with no backup plan

## Technical difficulties
- Recorded demo as backup
- Local environment that doesn't need internet
- Screenshots/slides of key points

## The ending (post Q/A)
- Summary of what they saw
- How it solves THEIR problem
- Clear next steps

If they call it "projects" don't call it "workspaces" in your demo.

## Memorability 
- Pair with a physical item
- Surprising theme
