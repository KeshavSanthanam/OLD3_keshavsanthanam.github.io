"Most deals die in follow-up" (source?)

Set next steps at end of every call/meeting 
- specific action with date and outcome 
- schedule on both calendars 

Don't send "just checking in" emails; instead: 
- "saw this article about [their problem]"
- "here's how company X solved similar issue"
- "found an answer to this question you asked"

If they ghost: 
- one more try with deadline
- "hey, should I close this out or is there still interest?"

Track your follow-ups
- spreadsheet works
- CRM better

Persistence vs being annoying
- provide constant value
