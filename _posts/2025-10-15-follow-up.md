most deals die in follow-up
- not because they said no
- because nobody followed up

set next steps at end of every call
- specific date
- specific action
- specific outcome

don't send "just checking in" emails
- nobody responds to these
- shows you have nothing valuable to say

instead, bring value
- "saw this article about [their problem]"
- "here's how company X solved similar issue"
- "found answer to question you asked"

calendar the follow-up before you hang up
- "let's sync next Tuesday at 2pm to review the POC results"
- put it on both calendars right then

if they ghost
- one more try with deadline
- "hey, should I close this out or is there still interest?"
- gives them easy out

track your follow-ups
- spreadsheet works
- CRM better
- whatever you'll actually use

persistence vs annoying
- persistence = consistent value
- annoying = begging for attention
