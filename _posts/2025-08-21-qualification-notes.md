BANT framework (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
- still works but feels outdated
- people lie about budget

better approach: pain-first qualification
- what breaks today?
- what's the cost of doing nothing?
- who else feels this pain?

red flags
- "just exploring options"
- can't get time with decision maker
- timeline is "whenever"
- they want a demo before discovery

qualification isn't one conversation
- first call: confirm there's a real problem
- second call: confirm they'll actually do something about it
- third call: confirm we're the right solution

don't qualify them out too early
- sometimes they don't know they have budget until they see the solution
- sometimes the "researcher" becomes your internal champion

qualify yourself too
- can we actually solve this?
- will we be successful here?
- is this worth our time?

if you're not disqualifying anyone, you're wasting time
