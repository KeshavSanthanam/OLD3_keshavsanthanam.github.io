## Types of competition
1. **Direct competitors** - other products that do the same thing
2. **Indirect competitors** - different solutions to the same problem
3. **Status quo** - keep doing what they're doing now
4. **Build it themselves**

## How to talk about competition
**Never trash the competition.**

Instead:
- Acknowledge their strengths
- Highlight your differences (**not better, just different**)
- Focus on fit for THIS customer's needs

Example:
Bad: "Competitor X is terrible and buggy"
Good: "Competitor X is a solid choice for smaller teams. Where we differ is in enterprise scalability and compliance features, which based on what you've told me seem important for your use case."

## The "do nothing" competitor
This is actually the hardest to beat. People are busy and change is hard. To overcome this you need to:
- Make the pain of staying clear
- Make the cost of waiting visible
- Reduce the friction of switching

Questions that help:
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"
- "What does this problem cost you today?"

## The "build it ourselves" competitor
Common with technical buyers. They think "how hard could it be?"

Points to make:
- Total cost of ownership (their engineering time is expensive)
- Time to value (building takes months/years)
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Opportunity cost (what else could the team build with that time?)

## Competitive deals
When you're directly against a competitor:
- Understand why they're considering both
- Find your unique angle (don't compete on price)
- Focus on fit, not features
- Build relationships (people buy from people they trust)
