Every deal has competition. Might be another product, might be "do nothing", might be building in-house. Need to understand the landscape.

## Types of competition
1. **Direct competitors** - other products that do the same thing
2. **Indirect competitors** - different solutions to the same problem
3. **Status quo** - keep doing what they're doing now
4. **Build it themselves** - especially common with engineering orgs

## How to talk about competition
**Never trash the competition.** Seriously. It makes you look desperate and unprofessional.

Instead:
- Acknowledge their strengths
- Highlight your differences (not better, just different)
- Focus on fit for THIS customer's needs

Example:
Bad: "Competitor X is terrible and buggy"
Good: "Competitor X is a solid choice for smaller teams. Where we differ is in enterprise scalability and compliance features, which based on what you've told me seem important for your use case"

## The "do nothing" competitor
This is actually the hardest to beat. People are busy and change is hard. To overcome this you need to:
- Make the pain of staying clear
- Make the cost of waiting visible
- Reduce the friction of switching

Questions that help:
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"
- "What does this problem cost you today?"

## The "build it ourselves" competitor
Common with technical buyers. They think "how hard could it be?"

Points to make:
- Total cost of ownership (their eng time is expensive)
- Time to value (building takes months/years)
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Opportunity cost (what else could the team build?)

Don't say they can't build it. They probably can. But should they?

## Competitive deals
When you're directly against a competitor:
- Understand why they're considering both
- Find your unique angle (don't be a cheaper version of them)
- Focus on fit not features
- Build relationships (people buy from people they trust)

The goal isn't to win every deal. It's to win the deals where you're actually the best fit.

Anyway competitive analysis is ongoing work not a one-time thing. Gotta stay sharp.
